# Mobile App Deployment Strategy

## Architecture Options

### Option 1: React Native (Recommended)
```bash
# Convert existing React components
npx react-native init CryptoBotPro
# Reuse 80% of existing UI components
# Add mobile-specific features
```

**Pros:**
- Reuse existing React/TypeScript code
- Single codebase for iOS/Android
- Native performance for trading features

**Cons:**
- Learning curve for React Native
- Some platform-specific code needed

### Option 2: Progressive Web App (PWA)
```javascript
// Add to existing app
// manifest.json for app-like experience
// Service worker for offline functionality
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal additional development
- Works on all platforms
- Easy updates

**Cons:**
- Limited native features
- App store approval challenges

### Option 3: Capacitor (Hybrid)
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init CryptoBotPro com.yourcompany.cryptobot
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
```

**Pros:**
- Use existing web app directly
- Access to native APIs
- Faster development

## Mobile-Specific Features to Add

### 1. Push Notifications
```typescript
// Signal alerts
interface PushNotification {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  data: {
    signal: Signal;
    action: 'buy' | 'sell' | 'alert';
  };
}
```

### 2. Biometric Authentication
```typescript
// Fingerprint/Face ID for app access
import { BiometricAuth } from '@capacitor/biometric-auth';
```

### 3. Background Processing
```typescript
// Keep bot running when app is minimized
import { BackgroundMode } from '@capacitor/background-mode';
```

### 4. Mobile-Optimized UI
- Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum)
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Bottom tab navigation
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
